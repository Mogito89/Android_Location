# Locate Me!
This is an android application which gives location (cell tower location) of the person who have installed this application. The working of this application is little bit unique. On receiving a keyword 'Location' via SMS ,the location of the recipient is sent to the sender of the SMS.  Eg: Suppose there is A,B,C,D  are family and A have installed this application and have given permission to B and C to access his/her location. So, whenever B or C sends SMS containing keyword 'Location' ,   the location of A is sent to them. Whereas if D sends the message containing Keyword 'Location', location of A won't be sent.  The main motive behind building this application was to keep track of student who come home late or aged people.  PS: GPS is not used to retrieve the location,CELL TOWER LOCATION is used, the place where this application was developed didn't had much support for GPS and was slower to retrieve location.
